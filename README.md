# Drafter-App
Full-stack drafting app created by Marco Woo (made for Software Design and Implentation CSE 331 at UW)

This web app allows two users to draft a team after providing a list of options. Once the list is provided, the user will be provided a draft ID
where another user can type in to start drafting the other side. Each user will take turns picking until the draft is complete, where the
operation will end.
